# Assignment2
Technically this is now

# Assignment 3
the only difference from Assignment 2 is that this
implementation uses Linked Lists.

# Assignment 4
If you wish to see how I completed Assignment 4, follow through the [Update journal.md](https://github.com/ImAmARobot/Assignment2/blob/master/Update%20journal.md). It is in chronological order top to bottom.

# Assignment 5
The same as assignment 4, but the Linked List is replaced with a binary tree, so no more need for a sort. I completed this by copy pasting code from Assignment 4, and making only the edits for binary trees. Unfortunately I did not make an update journal, mostly because the assignment was due and I had to finish it fast. There is also a new tree printing method, but all that has to be done is call the print from the driver program.
